                    <p id="Text">This semester was jam-packed with content from start to finish. First, we started with terminal, homebrewing Git and VSCode. We then continued to JavaScript to start writing our first lines of code in the class. We then progressed onto HTML and then CSS. Using p5, tone, or other JS databases, we created websites, each with our own creative flare. We then moved onto python to wrap the semester up, utilizing everything we learned throughout the term. Although I alredy knew quite a bit about coding prior to this class, I felt I learned a lot. From little tricks that save so much time, to new ways to use things I knew, I found this class to be very informative and quite fun. I would've never learned about homebrewing, or how amazing GitHub is, or the wonders of Web. All in all, I had a great semester and I cant wait to utlize what I learned in the class in my every day life.</p>
